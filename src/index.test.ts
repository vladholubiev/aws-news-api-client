This release also adds support for PyTorch 2.5 and introduces NxD Inference and Neuron Profiler 2.0 (beta). <a href="https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/index.html#nxdi-index" target="_blank">NxD Inference</a>, is a new PyTorch-based library integrated with vLLM, simplifies the deployment of large language and multi-modality models and enables PyTorch model onboarding with minimal code changes, and Neuron Profiler 2.0 (beta), is new profiler that enhances capabilities and usability, including support for distributed workloads.<br />
    <br />
    Neuron 2.21 also introduces Llama 3.1 405B model inference support using NxD Inference on a single trn2.48xlarge instance. The release updates Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) and Deep Learning AMIs (DLAMIs), and adds support for various model architectures, including Llama 3.2, Llama 3.3, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. New inference features include FP8 weight quantization and flash decoding for speculative decoding in Transformers NeuronX (TNx). Additionally, new training examples and features have been added, such as support for HuggingFace Llama 3/3.1 70B on Trn2 instances and DPO support for post-training model alignment.<br />
    <br />
    AWS Neuron SDK supports training and deploying models on Trn1, Trn2, and Inf2 instances, available in AWS Regions as On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, or part of Savings Plan.<br />

Notification action buttons are displayed on the notification details screen when you receive a push notification from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/notifications/" target="_blank">AWS User Notifications</a> on your mobile device. AWS customers can take actions like view logs, start, stop, or reboot an EC2 instance on an event notification to shorten incident response diagnosis and resolution times.<br />
    <br />
    With notification actions, you can quickly run common DevOps tasks based on your IAM permissions using notification action buttons. Notification actions are displayed automatically on notifications based on the state of the AWS resource. Using notification actions for event notifications, you can restart an EC2 instance the moment you receive an EC2 instance terminated push notification on your mobile device or get more information about an event notification without needing to return to your computer.<br />
    <br />
    The Console Mobile App lets users view and manage a select set of resources to stay informed and connected with their AWS resources while on-the-go.

SOCI Index Manifest v2 uses a cryptographic method to establish an explicit link between the image and its manifest, ensuring integrity and consistency during and across all deployment stages.<br />
    <br />
    To get started, create a SOCI index using the new convert subcommand in the soci CLI, available from the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter" target="_blank">SOCI Snapshotter GitHub repository</a>. Once generated, push the container image along with the SOCI index to your Amazon ECR repository, and use it to launch Amazon ECS tasks on AWS Fargate.<br />
    <br />
    As of today, SOCI Index Manifest v2 is the default mechanism for using SOCI with ECS and Fargate. If you&#39;re still using the legacy Manifest v1 implementation, we recommend upgrading to take advantage of the improved reliability and consistency. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html" target="_blank">documentation on using SOCI Index Manifest v2 with Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/improving-amazon-ecs-deployment-consistency-with-soci-index-manifest-v2" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
